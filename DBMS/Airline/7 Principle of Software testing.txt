1. Testing shows presence of defects
2. Exhaustive testing is not possible
3. Early Testing
4. Defect clustering
5. Pesticide paradox
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence of errors fallacy

Test case for black-box testing:
1. Boundary value analysis
2. Equivalence partitioning
3. State transition testing
4. Decision table testing
4. Graph based testing
5. Error guessing technique
